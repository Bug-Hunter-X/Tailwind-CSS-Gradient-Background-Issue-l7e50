# Tailwind CSS Gradient Background Issue

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior when using Tailwind CSS gradient backgrounds with multiple colors. The gradient doesn't appear as expected, and the solution is shown in `bugSolution.js`.

## Bug Description

When using the `bg-gradient-to-r` utility class with multiple colors, the gradient doesn't render correctly. Instead of a smooth transition between colors, it shows only one color or unexpected color combinations.

## Solution

The solution involves double-checking the Tailwind CSS configuration and ensuring that the color values are correctly specified and compatible with the gradient utility class. You may need to update the Tailwind CSS version or your `tailwind.config.js` file.
